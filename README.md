Let's say you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help us win.

The dataset contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which you can download [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/)

In order to figure out whether to study past questions, study general knowledge, or not study at all, it would be helpful to figure out two questions:

* How often the answer is deducible from the question?
* How often new questions are repeats of older questions?
